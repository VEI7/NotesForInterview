# 174. Dungeon Game

###Problem

The demons had captured the princess (**P**) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (**K**) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (*negative* integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (*0's*) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (*positive* integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

 

**Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.**

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least **7** if he follows the optimal path `RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN`.

| -2 (K) | -3   | 3      |
| ------ | ---- | ------ |
| -5     | -10  | 1      |
| 10     | 30   | -5 (P) |

 

**Note:**

- The knight's health has no upper bound.
- Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

###Solution

动态规划,建立一个二维数组 dp，其中 dp[i][j] 用来表示当前位置 (i, j) 出发的起始血量，最先处理的是公主所在的房间的起始生命值，然后慢慢向第一个房间扩散，不断的得到各个位置的最优的生命值。逆向推正是本题的精髓所在啊.仔细想想也是，如果从起始位置开始遍历，我们并不知道初始时应该初始化的血量，但是到达公主房间后，我们知道血量至少不能小于1，如果公主房间还需要掉血的话，那么掉血后剩1才能保证起始位置的血量最小。

```python
class Solution:
    def calculateMinimumHP(self, dungeon: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(dungeon)
        n = len(dungeon[0])
        dp = [[float('inf')]*(n+1) for i in range(m+1)]
        dp[m-1][n] = 1
        dp[m][n-1] = 1
        for i in range(m-1,-1,-1):
            for j in range(n-1,-1,-1):
                dp[i][j] = max(1, min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])-dungeon[i][j])
        return dp[0][0]
```
