# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

###Problem

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A *subsequence* of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A *common subsequence* of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
- The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.



###Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int m=text1.size(), n=text2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        for(int i=1; i<=m; i++)
            for(int j=1; j<=n; j++)
            {
                if(text1[i-1] == text2[j-1])
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i-1][j-1]+1;
                else
                    dp[i][j]=max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```



```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        n1 = len(text1)
        n2 = len(text2)
        dp = [[0]*(n2+1) for i in range(n1+1)]
        for i in range(n1):
            for j in range(n2):
                if text1[i] == text2[j]:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j]+1
                else:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
        return dp[-1][-1]
```



## 1092.Shortest Common Supersequence

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences.  If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

*(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen anywhere from T) results in the string S.)*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: 
str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
2. `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.



```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        n1 = len(str1)
        n2 = len(str2)
        dp = [[0]*(n2+1) for i in range(n1+1)]
        for i in range(n1):
            for j in range(n2):
                if str1[i] == str2[j]:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j]+1
                else:
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
        res = ''
        i, j = n1-1, n2-1
        while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
            if str1[i] == str2[j]:
                res = str1[i] + res
                i -= 1
                j -= 1
            elif dp[i+1][j+1] == dp[i+1][j]:
                res = str2[j] + res
                j -= 1
            else:
                res = str1[i] + res
                i -= 1
        while i>=0:
            res = str1[i] + res
            i -= 1
        while j>=0:
            res = str2[j] + res
            j -= 1
        return res
        
```
