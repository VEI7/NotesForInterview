# 127. Word Ladder

###Problem

Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

**Note:**

- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```


###Solution

BFS

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
        unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
        if(!wordSet.count(endWord))
            return 0;
        int res=1;
        queue<string> q;
        q.push(beginWord);
        while(!q.empty())
        {
            for(int i=q.size(); i>0; i--)
            {
                string word = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if(word == endWord) return res;
                for(int j=0; j< word.size(); j++)
                {
                    string newWord = word;
                    for(int k=0; k<26; k++)
                    {
                        newWord[j] = 'a'+k;
                        if(wordSet.count(newWord))
                        {
                            q.push(newWord);
                            wordSet.erase(newWord);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            res++;
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
    
};
```
